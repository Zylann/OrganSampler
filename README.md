Organ Sampler audio plugin
===========================

This is my first audio plugin, made with WDL-OL.
It's a sampler that can read Hauptwerk organ files, or at least it's my objective :)

I discovered GrandOrgue recently, but I was frustrated by the absence
of a VST hostable version. Maybe I could use virtual MIDI wires, but with no 
luck, and I didn't found a simple way to do this on Windows.

So I ended up learning how to program VST plugins from the very start,
just to be able to play with GrandOrgue files into my favourite DAW.

Please note that I developped this software as fast as I could to get results quickly,
so the code may not be pretty, there are work-in-progress parts, but 
it kinda works :) 

Here is an example of the plugin in action:
