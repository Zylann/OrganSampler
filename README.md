Organ Sampler audio plugin
===========================

This is my first audio plugin, made with WDL-OL.
It's a sampler that can read Hauptwerk organ files, or at least it's my objective :)
It can also read custom instruments you can define in JSON (I have to document the format yet).

Why
====

I discovered GrandOrgue recently, but I was frustrated by the absence
of a VST hostable version. Maybe I could use virtual MIDI wires, but with no 
luck, and I didn't found a simple way to do this on Windows.

So I ended up learning how to program VST plugins from the very start,
just to be able to play with GrandOrgue files into my favourite DAW,
and by the way, freely sample any sounds or instruments the way I like.

Please note that I developped this software as fast as I could to get results quickly,
so the code may not be pretty, there are work-in-progress parts, but 
it kinda works :)
